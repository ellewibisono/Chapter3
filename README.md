# Dissertation: Chapter 3

Data Analysis and preliminary results of chapter 3 of the Indonesian deep-water snapper and grouper fishery.
This chapter focuses on a spatially explicit standardization of the CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort) of the top catch species. 
When CPUE is standardized, it can represent the abundance/ fish biomass in the area. By making the analysis spatially explicit, we can compare approximate biomass of different species between fishing grounds.
